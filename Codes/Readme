These are the implementations of collective algorithms.

1. bintree - Pipelined Binary Tree.
2. 2TreeComplete - Pipelined Two Tree(best implementation using complete tree).
3. 2TreeBroadcast - Pipelined Two Tree (Using Sanders and Traff method given in paper "Two-Tree Algorithms for Full Bandwidth
Broadcast, Reduction and Scan").
4. linearPipeline - Pipelined linear tree algorithm.
5. MPI_BCAST - using predefined functions in MPICH library.
